a = [Ca - Ra,                   
     Ca + Ra]
b = [Cb - Rb, 
     Cb + Rb]

a + b = [Ca + Cb - (Ra + Rb),
         Ca + Cb + (Ra + Rb)]

Cab = Ca + Cb
Rab = Ra + Rb => radis of sum only deends on radius of args


a - b = [Ca - Cb - (Ra - Rb),
         Ca - Cb + (Ra - Rb)]

Cab = Ca - Cb
Rab = Ra - Rb => radius of sub only depends on radius of args

If the radius of the result was a function of the radius of the inputs,
then multiplying diferent intervals with the same radius should give
the same answer

[0, 10] * [1, 2] = [0, 20]
 R = 5    R = 0.5   R = 10
[1, 11] * [1, 2] = [1, 22]
 R = 5    R = 0.5   R = 10.5

 So, radius of multiplying or division is not a function of the radius
 of the args.
