All 3 problems point to the difficulty of "identity" when dealing with intervals

A = [2, 8]

We would assume that result of A/A is equal to [1, 1], but actually it's not...

A/A = [0.25, 4]

So, any time we do algebraic manipulation of an equalation involving intervals,
we need to be careful any time we introduce the same interval.

2.16 It's difficult....
